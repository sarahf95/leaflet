# leaflet

This is a tutorial for Leaflet!

More information about Lealet can be found here:

First you must download Leaflet!

Type these commands into the terminal

1. npm install
2. npm install leaflet

This creates a node.json file that stores leaflet information that our program can reference.

Now you must link the Leaflet stylesheet and javascript file to your index.html. (This has been down for you in the starter code on the master branch)

Add a div element to your html where you want your map to appear. Set an id so you can reference this div from your javascript.

To complete your javascript, follow the video tutorial here:

Thanks and good luck!
